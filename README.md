### jCleanup
A short and sweet Java program to quickly clean up your Linux directories.
Currently, jCleanup supports deleting files based on days, starting from today. 
Today's date is recorded and you can choose how far back the directory should 
be cleaned. Example: Today is 11/25/2020 and you want all files falling before
11/20/2020 to be deleted, you tell jCleanup '5' and those files disappear. It's 
that easy a process. 

### Instructions ###
1. Clone into home directory 
2. cd into scripts directory

3. run `chmod +x jCleanup.sh`

4. run `./jCleanup`
